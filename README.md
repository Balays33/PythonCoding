1. Fibonacci series (solution)
Write a simple Python program which will print Fibonacci series, e.g. 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ... . up to a given number. We prepare for cross questions like using iteration over recursion and how to optimize the solution using caching and memoization.

2. A prime number (solution)
Write a Python program to check if a given number is prime or not. Remember, a prime number is a number which is not divisible by any other number, e.g. 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Be prepared for cross, e.g. checking till the square root of a number, etc.

3. String Palindrome (solution)
You need to write a simple Python program to check if a given String is palindrome or not. A Palindrome is a String which is equal to the reverse of itself, e.g., "Bob" is a palindrome because of the reverse of "Bob" is also "Bob."  Though be prepared with both recursive and iterative solution of this problem. The interviewer may ask you to solve without using any library method, e.g. indexOf() or subString() so be prepared for that.

4. Integer Palindrome (solution)
This is generally asked as follow-up or alternative of the previous program. This time you need to check if given Integer is palindrome or not. An integer is called palindrome if it's equal to its reverse, e.g. 1001 is a palindrome, but 1234 is not because the reverse of 1234 is 4321 which is not equal to 1234. You can use divide by 10 to reduce the number and modulus 10 to get the last digit. This trick is used to solve this problem.

5. Armstrong number (solution)
A number is called an Armstrong number if it is equal to the cube of its every digit. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because of 153= 1+ 125+27, which is equal to 1^3+5^3+3^3. You need to write a program to check if the given number is Armstrong number or not.

6. Avoiding deadlock in Python (solution)
This is one of the interesting programs from Java Interviews, mostly asked to 2 to 3 years of experienced programmers or higher. The interviewer simply asked you to write code where a resource is accessed by multiple threads. You need to write code in such a way that no deadlock should occur. The trick to solving this problem is acquiring resources in order and release them in reverse order, e.g. first acquire resource R1 and only if you have got R1 to go for R2. This way, you can avoid deadlock.




72. Triangle

      An array A consisting of N integers is given. A triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if 0 ≤ P < Q < R < N and:

      A[P] + A[Q] > A[R],
      A[Q] + A[R] > A[P],
      A[R] + A[P] > A[Q].
      For example, consider array A such that:

        A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
        A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 20
      Triplet (0, 2, 4) is triangular.

      Write a function:

      class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

      that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns 1 if there exists a triangular 
      triplet for this array and returns 0 otherwise.

      For example, given array A such that:

        A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
        A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 20
      the function should return 1, as explained above. Given array A such that:

        A[0] = 10    A[1] = 50    A[2] = 5
        A[3] = 1
      the function should return 0.

      Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

      N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
      each element of array A is an integer within the range [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
